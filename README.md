A personal CLI time-mindfulness tool.

## Prerequisite Installations

Before you can run `titan`, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Rust and Cargo**: `titan` is written in Rust. You'll need Rust and its package manager, Cargo, to compile and run it. Install them using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

2. **gcalcli**: `titan` interfaces with Google Calendar using `gcalcli`. Install it using your package manager or follow the instructions on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli).

3. **play (from SoX)**: For the beeping functionality, `titan` uses the `play` command from the SoX package. Install SoX from your package manager or from the [official website](http://sox.sourceforge.net/).
